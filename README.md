## Getting Started

### Character Limits

The first input field is where you specify how many characters you would like to make the password.
**_We have hard limits of minimum 8 characters and maximum of 32 characters._**
If you enter a value that is not within this range, you will see that the program does not let you generate a password.
You are only allowed to enter numerical values into this field. (**0-9**)

### Exclusions

You may specify to the program certain characters you would like excluded from the final generated password.

The current list of available characters that the program can generate are as follows:

- All numbers **[0-9]**
- Uppercase letters **[A-Z]**
- Lowercase letters **[a-z]**
- Various Symbols **[@[]^\_`{|}~:;<=>?/\\]**

### Generating the password

The program will output the password in a text field that will allow you to copy onto the clipboard.
